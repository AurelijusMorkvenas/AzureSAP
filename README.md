## Overview

AzureSAP is a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed for processing and analyzing sales data. The project extracts data from an on-premises SQL Server database, processes it in Azure, and loads it into Azure Synapse Analytics for further analysis and visualization with Power BI.

## Objectives

- **Data Extraction**: Retrieve data from an on-premises SQL Server instance and load it into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- **Data Transformation**: Clean, structure, and aggregate the data in two phases using PySpark on Azure Databricks.
- **Data Analysis**: Load processed data into Azure Synapse Analytics for querying and connect it to Power BI for visualization and reporting.

## ETL Process

### Extract

- Use Azure Data Factory with Integration Runtime to securely extract data from SQL Server.
- Load the extracted data into the Bronze layer of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 as raw, unprocessed data.

### Transform

- **Bronze to Silver**: Perform data cleaning and apply basic transformations to prepare the data for further processing.
- **Silver to Gold**: Execute advanced transformations and aggregations to make the data analytics-ready.

### Load and Analyze

- Load the fully transformed data from the Gold layer into Azure Synapse Analytics for analysis.
- Use Power BI to create interactive dashboards and generate insights for decision-making.

## Folder Structure in Azure Data Lake

Azure Data Lake Gen2 is used for organizing the data in different stages of the ETL pipeline:

- **Bronze Layer**: Contains raw, unprocessed data extracted directly from the SQL Server.
- **Silver Layer**: Stores intermediate data that has been cleaned and partially transformed.
- **Gold Layer**: Holds the final, fully transformed, and aggregated data that is ready for analytics and reporting.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- An active Azure subscription.
- An on-premises SQL Server with the AdventureWorks2022 database installed.
- Azure services configured:
  - Azure Data Factory
  - Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
  - Azure Databricks
  - Azure Synapse Analytics
  - Power BI Desktop (or access to the Power BI Service)

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AurelijusMorkvenas/AzureSAP
    ```

2. **Set Up Linked Services in Azure Data Factory**:
    - Configure a Linked Service for SQL Server using the Integration Runtime.
    - Create a Linked Service for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

3. **Pipeline Setup in Azure Data Factory**:
    - Import the provided pipeline JSON file into Azure Data Factory.
    - Modify connection strings, credentials, and configurations as needed.
    - Set up a trigger to run the pipeline as per your schedule.

4. **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**:
    - Create a storage account with the following folder structure:
        - `bronze/` for raw extracted data.
        - `silver/` for cleaned and partially processed data.
        - `gold/` for analytics-ready data.

5. **Azure Databricks**:
    - Create a Databricks workspace and a compute cluster.
    - Import the provided notebooks and configure the cluster for PySpark execution.
    - Use the notebooks to perform the Bronze-to-Silver and Silver-to-Gold transformations.

6. **Azure Synapse Analytics**:
    - Set up a Synapse Analytics workspace.
    - Create a database and deploy the provided stored procedure for serverless views.
    - Use the provided SQL scripts to create views on the Gold layer data.

7. **Power BI**:
    - Install Power BI Desktop.
    - Connect to Azure Synapse Analytics to build interactive reports and dashboards.
    - Publish your Power BI reports to the Power BI Service (optional).

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL Server**: Source database hosting AdventureWorks2022.
- **Azure Data Factory**: For extracting and moving data into Azure.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2**: To store data in Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
- **Azure Databricks**: For scalable data transformations using PySpark.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: For querying and integrating the Gold layer data.
- **Power BI**: For building dashboards and visualizing insights.
